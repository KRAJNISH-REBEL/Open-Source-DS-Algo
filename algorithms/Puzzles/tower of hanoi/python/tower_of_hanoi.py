Tower of Hanoi Puzzle Implementation in Python

Author: Rebel Technology / ChatGPT
Description:
This module demonstrates the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks.
The objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    2. Each move involves taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on another rod.
    3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

    Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively.

    Parameters:
    n (int): Number of disks
    source (str): The rod from which to move disks initially
    auxiliary (str): The rod used as a helper
    destination (str): The rod to move all disks to

    Prints:
    Steps to move each disk from source to destination rod.

    Time Complexity: O(2^n)
        - Each disk move generates two recursive calls.
    Space Complexity: O(n)
        - Due to the recursion call stack.
